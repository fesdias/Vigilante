            <p>The project, initially developed as a bachelor thesis, has evolved into a paper currently IN PRESS with Springer at EAI ArtsIT journal. But this is only Chapter I - we still have a lot to discuss about mankind's future.</p>
            <p id="abstract">F. S. Dias, A. Moroni, H. Pedrini. Using Generative Models to Create a Visual Description of Climate Change. EAI ArtsIT. Springer (2023).<br><br><b>ABSTRACT:</b> The discrepancy between the rapid dissemination of information and its effective communication underlies the phenomenon of scientific denialism. Given the rapid strides in AI generative models, this project explores the domain of knowledge visualization to portray weather data through a visually captivating representation of Rio de Janeiro's climate evolution up to the year 2100. The use of prompt engineering over climate models has yielded promising outcomes in image generation, yet challenges remain in ensuring deterministic accuracy in image construction.</p>

            <p>We believe in the power of art to stimulate discussions around significant topics. <b>Here is where we aim to amplify voices.</b></p>

                <h3>1. Climate Change</h1>
                <p>While a significant portion of the population acknowledges climate change, research conducted by Yale revealed that 47% of Americans did not believe that global warming would personally harm them. We strive to transform the abstract findings into a tangible reality, enabling people to better comprehend what the numbers are saying. <b>How can we make them see what we see?</b></p>

                <h3>2. Voice of Science</h1>
                <p>The battle against scientific denialism is part of Academia. Effectively sharing our university findings to the general population should be a primary goal of science today. As we witness with COVID-19 and climate change, we need collective action to address these issues. So, <b>how can we restore faith in science?</b></p>

                <p>We are on the edge of a disruption by AI, particularly in creative fields. <b>How can we harness this technology to our advantage? What will art look like after generative models such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E? What level of technological literacy should we provide to the population to ensure humans are not replaced by machines?</b></p>
